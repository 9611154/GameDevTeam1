# 1.Core Gameplay and Mechanics:
* This is a strategy and combat game. The core of the game revolves around stopping enemy balloons from reaching the exits by slowing them down and popping them in various ways. Players will choose where to place their various defenses, with many different defenses to choose from. Placing them in the right spot is the key to victory. Players will be able to level up their defenses to make them stronger. There will be audio feedback from when something pops or when something is thrown. There will be different audio depending on the action. There will also be visual feedback in the form of something being thrown or destroyed.
# 2. Story and Setting:
* There is no narrative in this game, the setting changes from game to game. There will be two maps, a beach-based map with sand and water, and a grass map with rolling hills. The maps will have a path that the balloons follow, winding up and down and around the map.
# 3. Art and Sound Design:
* This game is using 2D models. We are going to create custom assets as we as using existing ones. Background pops will be a big part of the game. There will also be a short looping soundtrack for music.
# 4. Difficulty and Progression:
* The difficulty of the game will progress with rounds. Each round more balloons will be used, as well as the introduction of some new balloons, with strengths and weaknesses. It is a continuous play experience with rounds, in between these rounds is time for the user to upgrade their characters and defense.
# 5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):
* When the player loads the game it says (start) and when you click that you will see your monkeys and power-ups in the right half of the screen, and in the top left you will see your lives and bananas.
Our control schemes are very intuitive and accessible because it is easy to navigate, and all audiences will be able to play it.


# 6:Technical Requirements:
* We will be using processing.org.
* A challenging part of the programming will be the hit detection between the projectiles and the target.
# 7:Team Roles and Collaboration:
* Coder: Jack Morrison,  Art: Lincoln Tayler, Manager: Jack Durram, Designer: Cole Tayler
* We will use GitHub to collaborate.
# 8. Target Audience:
* Our game is for casual gamers who want to chill and still have some thought into the game they are playing. 
* Our game is more cartoony and has a bright and colorful map, the main characters are monkeys so our game might be considered good for younger audiences.
